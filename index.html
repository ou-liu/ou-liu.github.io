		Theory and Evidence from Decomposing Top Sales Share Growth"</a> </b></p>	
	     
	     <p><b><em> Abstract: </em></b>
	      <b>I study the causes and implications of the rise in firm sales concentration by inferring the underlying innovation process that drives
		     firm dynamics. To achieve this, I first use an accounting decomposition to identify two sources of top share growth: (i) incumbent 
		     top firms grow bigger; (ii) new top firms replace old top firms. When individual firms grow in response to an own innovation shock
		     and shrink at the impact of a creative destruction shock, the growth of top share can result either from an increase in own 
		     innovation or a decrease in creative destruction. I then build an analytical framework and show that own innovation and creative
		     destruction have a differential impact on the two components of top share growth. Via this mechanism, I use the two sources of
		     top share growth obtained from the accounting decomposition to identify the rates of own innovation and creative destruction that 
		     drive firm dynamics. I find that the rise in annualized top share growth rate from -0.71% over the 1980-1995 period to 1.35% over 
		     the 1995-2010 period is mainly due to an increase in own innovation, while the increase in creative destruction offsets a small
		     amount of top share growth.</b>

<p><b><em> Abstract: </em></b>		<b>We use monthly Current Population Survey data to document employment changes during
the COVID-19 pandemic at the occupation, industry, and metropolitan statistical area (MSA)
levels. Over March-April 2020, jobs losses are larger for occupations with higher physical
proximity or lower work-from-home feasibility, especially for lower-paying occupations. Nonessential industries also see greater declines in employment. Such occupational and industrial
susceptibility to COVID-19 contributes to the variation in employment changes across MSAs:
Employment shrinks more for MSAs with larger pre-crisis fractions of workers employed in occupations with higher infection risk. Over April-June 2020, occupations and industries that are
hit harder recoup more jobs, but the recovery is only partial. Moreover, the gains are concentrated in lower-paying occupations and a few industries. Taken together, these abrupt changes
in employment following the COVID-19 outbreak are unprecedented and potentially have longterm implications for occupational inequality and regional disparity.

				<p><b><em> Abstract: </em>
	      	This paper studies how income inequality at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level affect
mortgage credit allocation along the income distribution of households within MSAs. I find that MSAlevel income inequality has heterogeneous effect on household-level mortgage debt accumulation.
Two measures of inequality, the ratio of 95th-to-80th percentile (p95/p80) and the ratio of 80th-to-50th
percentile (p80/p50) of household income, exhibit significant impact. With respect to credit approval
along the income distribution, high p95/p80 inequality works more in favor of low-income households while high p80/p50 inequality benefits high-income households more.
